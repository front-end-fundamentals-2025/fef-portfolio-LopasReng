    <h1>Lovisa Garnemark</h1>
    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I am currently pursuing my studies at Jönköping University, specializing 
        in Graphic Design and Web Development, also known as New Media Design, 
        with an international focus. Additionally, I hold a higher education 
        preparatory diploma from Göteborgs Tekniska Gymnasium, where I 
        graduated with dual degrees. I completed the Technology Program with a 
        specialization in Design and Product Development while simultaneously 
        earning a certification as a high school engineer.
        I am a highly driven individual who strives to continuously build on my 
        professional experiences and kickstart my career while studying. I have 
        a diverse range of experiences, having worked in various roles across 
        different industries. My background includes roles in automotive 
        production as well as planning projects and delivering presentations in 
        office and lecture environments. I would describe myself as social, 
        organized, goal-oriented, and a fast learner. I enjoy meeting new people 
        and working collaboratively. I value structure both in my daily life and 
        in the workplace. I am committed to achieving my goals and work diligently 
        to reach them. Throughout my life, I have often been recognized for my 
        ability to quickly grasp new concepts, whether they involve computer 
        software or hands-on tasks.

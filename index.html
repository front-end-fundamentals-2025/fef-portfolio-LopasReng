        I am currently pursuing my studies at JÃ¶nkÃ¶ping University, specializing 
        in Graphic Design and Web Development, also known as New Media Design, 
        with an international focus. Additionally, I hold a higher education 
        preparatory diploma from GÃ¶teborgs Tekniska Gymnasium, where I 
        graduated with dual degrees. I completed the Technology Program with a 
        specialization in Design and Product Development while simultaneously 
        earning a certification as a high school engineer.
